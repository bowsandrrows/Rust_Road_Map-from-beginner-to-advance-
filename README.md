## 🧭 Beginner Level: Foundations

### 🎯 Goals
- Understand Rust syntax and basic programming concepts
- Learn Rust’s unique features: ownership, borrowing, lifetimes

### 📚 Resources
- [The Rust Programming Language Book ("The Book")](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings): Hands-on exercises
- [Let's Get Rusty YouTube Series](https://www.youtube.com/c/LetsGetRusty): Beginner-friendly walkthroughs

### 🛠 Topics to Cover
- Variables, data types, functions
- Control flow (if, match, loops)
- Ownership, borrowing, lifetimes
- Structs, enums, pattern matching
- Error handling (`Result`, `Option`)
- Modules and packages (`cargo`, `crates.io`)

---

## 🚀 Intermediate Level: Practical Rust

### 🎯 Goals
- Build real-world applications
- Understand Rust’s type system and traits
- Explore concurrency and memory safety

### 📚 Resources
- [Idiomatic Rust in Simple Steps (IRISS)](https://github.com/TomCat-415/learnrust)
- [Rust Crash Course – FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF34dRivLOw)
- [100 Exercises to Learn Rust](https://github.com/TomCat-415/learnrust)

### 🛠 Topics to Cover
- Traits and generics
- Collections and iterators
- Closures and functional programming
- Smart pointers (`Box`, `Rc`, `RefCell`)
- Concurrency (`threads`, `channels`, `async/await`)
- Error propagation and custom error types
- Unit and integration testing

---

## 🧠 Advanced Level: Systems & Performance

### 🎯 Goals
- Write performant, safe, and idiomatic Rust
- Dive into unsafe code and FFI
- Explore Rust in systems, web, and embedded domains

### 📚 Resources
- [GeeksforGeeks Rust Roadmap](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rust/rust-roadmap/)
- [Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/): For unsafe Rust
- [Roadmap.sh Rust Developer Guide](https://roadmap.sh/rust)

### 🛠 Topics to Cover
- Advanced lifetimes and trait bounds
- Macros and metaprogramming
- Unsafe Rust and FFI (Foreign Function Interface)
- WebAssembly with Rust
- Embedded systems programming
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Building libraries and contributing to open source

---

## 🧪 Projects to Cement Learning

- CLI tools (e.g., todo app, file parser)
- Web backend with [Actix](https://actix.rs/) or [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/)
- Game development with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/)
- Systems-level tools (e.g., memory profiler, custom shell)
- Solve [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges in Rust

---

## 🧭 Final Tips

- Join the [Rust community](https://users.rust-lang.org/)
- Read and contribute to open-source Rust projects on GitHub
- Follow Rustaceans on Twitter, Reddit, and Discord
- Practice consistently—Rust rewards persistence
